# WordyNerdy
## Description
This is the third project of mine called WordyNerdy. This is going to an android app made with Java.

The pemise of this game is that you are given parts of a word and you have to fill in the blank. The more words that you figure out, the larger your score becomes. The object of the game is collect as many points as possible without trying a word that doesn't exist.

## Installation
This game will be installed through the Google Play Store and probably the Samsung Galaxy Store. 

You can also download the code from here and run it on an emulator from your computer.

## Usage
(This will be posted when the 1st version of the game is launched.)

## Support
When the game is launched, support for this game will be created.

Since I couldn't find a good or cheap dictionary api, I had to put the words myself using some lists I found but they aren't very extensive. Therefore, some actual words may be missing from the word bank and therefore hurt gameplay. Thats why I'll be creating a ticketing platform to submit reports and new words which can be added in the next update.

## Roadmap
The plan for this app is to launch it around July or August with the latest being around October.

After launch various updates will be created from user feedback and to continue populating the in-game dictionary. Around this time, the app will be made open source for people to contribute to this project.

Sometime in in the end of 2023 or early 2024, a large update will be pushed in which leaderboard and multiplayer will be added.

## Contributing
As of now, contributions will not be accepted since the project hasn't been launched yet. However, the plan is for this project to become open source sometime in the future for other people to contibute to this project.

## Authors and Acknowledgement
This app is made completely by Parth Mehta or @ParthM02.

I would also like to acknowledge my dad for his guidence on this project as well as other websites who taught me the complex topics utilized on this project.

## License
This currecntly does not have an open sourse license but one will be added in the future.

## Project Status
Project development is currently delayed due to School. Development is scheduled to resume in Spring/Summer 2023.

Note: The project was started in Summer of 2022 and is currently about 75% through development.

Functionality of the app is finished, however numerous quality and visual aspects are still being worked on.
